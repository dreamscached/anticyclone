# Anticyclone
ðŸŒ€ Anticyclone, a curated list of sites cluttering your Google results page with site proxies/clones.

This repository contains lists of domains that copy StackOverflow questions and answers, auto-translate 
them into different languages, proxy GitHub (just like the infamous gitMemory site) and otherwise
clutter search results when you look up your problem or code chunk.

Plain text list of domains is available [here](domains.txt) and it's more eye-candy version of it is available [here](LIST.md).
